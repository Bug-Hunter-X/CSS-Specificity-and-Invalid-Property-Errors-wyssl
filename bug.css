The CSS code has a specificity issue where a more specific selector unintentionally overrides a more general one, leading to unexpected styling. For example:

```css
#container { color: blue; }
.item #container { color: red; }
```

In this case, `.item #container` is more specific than `#container`, overriding the blue color even if `#container` is defined earlier. This is because of the higher specificity of `class id` combination over the `id` selector.

Another issue could be the use of an incorrect or unsupported CSS property in some browsers which could cause unexpected results.

Another common issue is the use of invalid CSS syntax which can cause the whole CSS to not be parsed.
